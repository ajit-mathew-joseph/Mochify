            Hi! My name is Georgia, I am 24 years old, and I am a lifelong gamer
            and artist. I particularly enjoy designing and creating cute
            products like stickers and wallets. At the start of the pandemic, I
            set up an Etsy store, kickstarting my entrepreneurship journey.

          <p className="about__quality-products--paragraph">
            As I continued to grow my Etsy store, I was also inspired to
            consider creating and designing a broader range of products to serve
            my growing customer base.
          </p>

          <p className="about__quality-products--paragraph">
            To that end, I set up Mochify, my attempt at continuing to serve my
            loyal customers with cute products but also offering products like
            accessories to enhance their experience.
          </p>

          <p className="about__quality-products--paragraph">
            I work to make sure that each product I list is of the highest
            quality and is made with love and care.

            I am a mother to 3 cats: Cleo, Luna, and Sprinkles. Animal care advocacy is super important to me

            10% of Mochify's gross sales go to the World Wildlife Federation and the American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (ASPCA),
            ensuring that both wild animals and abandoned animal causes are well supported.
